While analyzing a Bayesian game, one needs to ascertain the probability of each game. This method is meant to return this probability value.

To be used: the book on Conservation Laws and Symmetry, to help figure out the different event spaces, plus Zeno's dichotomy paradox of halving distance and never reaching the destination
